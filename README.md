# CCRL

## Name
Copula based common representation learning (CCRL).

## Description
Code of the architecture of CCRL as well as some experiments, implemented by python 3.7 and pytorch 1.8(or 1.10) .
* CCRL.py: architecture of CCRL for MNIST transfer learning and XRMB data fution classification.
* MonotonicNN.py, NeuralIntegral.py, ParallelNeuralIntegral.py are from https://github.com/AWehenkel/UMNN/tree/master/models/UMNN, with little modification, to bulid MonotonicNNs in CCRL. 
* Dataloader.py: load MNIST and two-view XRMB datasets, first to down load the datasets provided in the links in the file, and place them in the same directory as Dataloader.py .
* train_model.py: model training for MNIST and XRMB
* objective.py: CCRL's loss function
* main4test.py: train CCRL representations of two views.
* successive_classification_XRMB.py: load pretrained TD-CCRL for original feature transformation, then lda classification is conducted by using concatenated transformed features.
* successive_classification_MNIST.py: load pretrained CCRL(TD-CCRL) for original feature transformation, then SVM classification is conducted by using concatenated transformed features.
* utils_.py: some basic functions
* simulated_experiment1: experiments of CCRL, DCA and DCCA on a testbed
* simulated_experiment2: CCRL's classification case on concentric circles and two-moons dataset.
* out: saved pretrained CCRL(TD-CCRL) model and transformed features

 
## Usage
### 1. retrained CCRL(TD-CCRL) model
* main4test.py: change the hyper params in loss function of CCRL if needed
* train_model.py: find the TODO part to choose to conduct model training on XRMB or MNIST, and the corresponding task(None, 'L2R', 'R2L', 'SupervisedDataFusion', tasks will show their difference in CCRL.py).

### 2. load the pretrained CCRL(TD-CCRL) model for successive classification
* successive_classification_MNIST.py, successive_classification_XRMB.py: find the TODO part, to load the pretrained models, or to load the presaved features(MNIST.7z need to be unzipped, while out feartures of XRMB are not contained here cause the size of XRMB.7z is larger than 2G (actually has 6G)), to conduct classification.
